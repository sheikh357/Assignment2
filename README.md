#Pre-processing
the first pre-processing file just simply takes a small amount of data for testing. What we have done is that we have taken the data from the csv and removed the columns that weren't needed. After removing them we have converted them into singular rows as the data contained multiple rows having the same ID so we mergered all the rows with the similar ids to a single row. Then we use the regular text pre-processing techniques on the section text.

#Pre-processing 2
Here we have taken a much bigger amount of data of 1-GB and all the preprocessing is taking place like in the previous file but on addition is made here we are spliting the data to csv's that would be splitted amongst the Azure Vm's that are generated.
